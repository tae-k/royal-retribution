# Assignment 12 #
=================

Design (Derek)
- updated blocks
- created big boss enemy
- created main boss enemy

New Loading Screen (Idean)
  - Animated and indicative of progress
Updated High Score System (Idean)
  - Less buggy, doesn't require a file to already exist
Fixed bugs in Loading and High Score from last week (Idean)
  - Cleaned code and fixed several bugs remaining.
Recording Key Strokes (Idean)
  - Began working on recording key strokes for later playback.
Menu Screen Upgrade (Idean)
  - Worked on an animated background for menu screen.

Enemy Movement (Tae Jin Kim)
- the enemies now move randomly

Big Boss (Tae Jin Kim/ Billy)
- setup how the big boss acts
- uses two big hands (each have 5 HP)
  ~ it smashes the ground at intervals (your old location)
  ~ you can only damage the hand while it is on the ground
  ~ the hands are very powerful (bring hit by one -> lose full heart)

Main Boss (Billy)
- after the big boss dies, the main boss appears
~Phase 1
- he summons 3 clones
- they stand still and you have to attack 1.
- if you attack the correct 1 he takes damage and they all turn transparent to 
  let you know it was the correct one.
- it then is invincible while they switch positions.
- if you attack the wrong one the real one chases you and the clones disappear
- you can either hit him while he comes at you and then he resets
- If you don't hit him you take damage then he resets.
- when he has one hp left he goes to phase 2
~Phase2 
- he turns red and starts chasing you.
- he is invincible during that time.
- after 4 seconds he will turn green and stop for 2 seconds.
- hit him while he is green to kill him.

Other
- working on editing how score is saved (Idean)
- all walls are combined into one -> increases efficiency (Idean)
- mini enemy transforms earlier so that it's easier to notice the (Tae Jin)

LEVEL 4

Design (Derek)
- new map
- edited animations

Level_4_State setup (Tae Jin Kim)

New Enemy (Tae Jin Kim)
- called mini enemy
1) appears as a chest
2) waits for the king to get close
3) transforms and starts chasing king
*) made it so that the enemies cary around the chests, cute lol (Billy)

New Hitbox (Billy)
- only bottom half of character and enemies collide

New Moving Trap (Billy)
- the spinning blades in level 4 move around in an unpredictable manner

Map Additions (Billy & Derek)
- Derek created and Billy edited the map additions
  ~ in order to match up the new enemies with the chests

Overall Improvement of Code (Idean)
- improved collisions (very few bugs now)
- cleaned up code to improve look and efficiency

Extra
- losing shows king giving up (Tae Jin Kim)

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Concerning Levels
- new music plays in-game
- instruction texts are now centered
- instruction texts are more event-specific
- panning does not have glitchy flying images
  * how to skip panning instructions were added
  * panning can now move in multiple directions

Concerning Character
- character cannot push around enemies
- character cannot run through enemies
- sword hitbox has become more accurate
- character actually "falls" down a hole
  ~ the hole does not remain in the level
- running no longer sneaks past enemies (you are louder when you run)

Other
- character can run forever with [RSHIFT] (for testing)
- highscore and credit screens show how to return to main
- many of the bugs related to collision have been removed

Concerning Coding
*  The collision detection and resolution system has almost completely been
   rewritten to take into position the true double value of the characters,
   rather than the SDL-preferred integer value of the pixels. This solves many
   issues described above related to characters pushing and going through
   walls.

*  Previously, many functions unrelated to levels were scattered throughout the
   level_x_state.cpp files in order to accomplish certain goals via quick, sim-
   ple fixes. To keep our code DRY, we factored out most of the common code into
   a "playing_state.cpp" file. Also, it became unintuitive to have files doing
   multiple different tasks, so all enemy-related code was moved to enemy.cpp
   and most of the character-related code was moved to character.cpp. In the
   coming weeks, we will continue to factor out as much as possible and to keep
   our new structure consistent.

*  We also realized that many of the x_state files were using similar functions
   "privately" rather than sharing them under a "protected" class. This was fi-
   xed by placing these function within state.cpp.

*  Lots of skeleton code that is now obsolete has been removed from various
   places throughout the codebase, and code from collisions has been factored
   out into "util" file for use in other places.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Assets (Derek Chang)
- created all assets and map layout.

Fixed Time-step (Idean)
- Using a fixed timestep now throughout.

Fixed Collision Bugs (Idean)
- Fixed many bugs related to collision resolution. Especially due to rounding
  issues.

Levels (Tae)
~ press [p] to pause the game
~ press [r] to resume the game
~ press [0] to automatically lose
~ press [1] to go to the prev level (!@level1)
~ press [2] to go to the next level (win @level3)
~ at the start of each level: panning scene - shows where the stairs are
  * if you want to skip this scene, press [m]

Fixed Sword Implementation (Tae)
~ it is its own separate sprite
~ cool combo: [space], run right after

Seg Fault Mistakes (Billy)
~ enemies were randomy causing seg faults
~ seg faults now no longer occur when touching a trap

Created new Trap (Billy)
~ spinning blades king must evade
~ health powerup you will get you an extra heart
  ~ and you will regain full health.

Instruction texts(Billy and Tae)
~ when activating trap getting a key or falling down a hole, the game will pause
   and you will get an text saying what happened.

All levels are now subclassed (Billy)
~ fixed many bugs associated with the levels
  * enemies were not acting correctly, faciltate changing up code

Collision Grid/Buckets (Idean)
- Split the map into a grid layout, and collision checks occur within each grid.
- Changed the collision resolution logic to use velocities rather than collision
  rectangles for determining the collision direction. This should fix many bugs
  with collisions that may occur when clipping corners.
- Made enhancements to the update and collisions logic to increase the FPS of
  the game enormously.
- Initial implementation of a fixed time-step (in progress by next week)

Traps (Billy)
1) when a character steps into a room, traps activate
2) the doors close behind him and he cannot escape unless...
3) he kills one of the enemies in the room before they kill him
* During Gameplay, the screen will go "TRAPPED, KILL THEM ALL TO ESCAPE"

Chest and Doors (Billy)
1) walking up to a chest and pressing e will open the chest.
2) item will show up below stamina bar to simulate an inventory.
3) if item is a key, walking up to a door and pressing e will open it.
4) after opening the door, the key is used and disappears.
5) After getting keys a text appears that says the key is to be used on a special door
* when opening a chest, make sure to be  walking towards
  it at the same time

Holes (Billy)
1) walking upon a cracked hole will cause you to fall down a floor
2) your position will be set to a fixed position on level 1

Instructions (Tae Jin Kim)
1) added a new instruction for opening chests
2) made it so pressing buttons before the instructions show up do not cause
   the instructions to be fulfilled

Intro (Tae Jin Kim)
1) fixed the issue where the character can move during the intro
2) edited the location (position & throne) and events of the throne room

King Level (Tae Jin Kim)
1) killing enemies increases your experience
2) you level up once you kill enough enemies
3) it becomes harder to level up as your level increases

Floor Movement (Tae Jin Kim)
Floor 1 to Floor 2    press [2]
Floor 1 to lose       press [3]
Floor 2 to win        press [2]
Floor 2 to lose       press [3]

Other (Tae Jin Kim)
~ edited all of the states so that they utilized maps rather than vectors

IN-PROGRESS FIXES
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
Attacking animations. There is a janky change in position occuring when
attacking. To fix this, we are currently splitting the sword sprite from the
character sprite so that the character will stay in the same position on the map
while the sword swings and checks for collisions.

Notes:
  After running with both valgrind and sanitizers, there are many leaks that
  are coming directly from SDL. All dynamically allocated elements are freed
  all surfaces are freed before reassignment, all textures, audio, the rend-
  erer, and window are all destroyed whenever the application quits, and all
  SDL libraries have been quit when the application panics and when it clos-
  es successfully.
